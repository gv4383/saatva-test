# Saatva Hiring Test

This project was created using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Though some argue that TypeScript is overkill in a small project like this, I like to argue that the tooling that comes with it is very valuable and can save some headaches with simple bugs in the long run.

With the exception of using bootstrap (for the cart and star icons), no external component library was used for this project. All buttons and such were custom built, including the star rating component.

## Getting Started

Start by cloning the project to your machine. Once the project is cloned, make sure you are using the appropriate version of node. As noted in the `.nvmrc` file, this project uses version `14.16.0`. If you're using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), simply run the following command when in the root directory:

```
nvm use
```

Once that's done, install the project dependencies with the following command:

```
npm i
```

After installing the project dependencies, you should be able to run the project with:

```
npm start
```
